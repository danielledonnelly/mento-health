    <!-- At the time I'm typing this, I've decided that this is going to be a simple little one commit project that I never link to directly.-->
    <!-- It's just a little creative writing exercise to get my green square lit up for the day on GitHub. So it's very possible that nobody will ever read this.-->
    <!-- But in case someone ever does, I wanted to share a fun fact I learned.-->
    <!-- A lot of people think that a chemical reaction occurs when you drop mentos into soda. I did too.-->
    <!-- I always figured there had to be some strange ingredient in mentos that caused such a dramatic result.-->
    <!-- But there isn't. The eruption is actually a physical reaction, not a chemical one. -->
    <!-- Mentos happen to have a really rough surface with a lot of teeny tiny holes. -->
    <!-- Those holes allow bubbles to form extremely quickly on the candy's surface. -->
    <!-- This creates a lot of pressure and forces the soda to shoot out of the bottle. -->
    <!-- I think that's really interesting. -->

        <h1>Soda Bottle Brain</h1>
        <h3><i>A poem about mento health</i> <br><br></h3>
        <p id="line1" class="line hidden">My brain is a big bottle of soda.</p>
        <p id="line2" class="line hidden">It seems deceptively sweet and bubbly at first.</p>
        <p id="line3" class="line hidden">But it can be unhealthy and highly reactive.</p>
        <p id="line4" class="line hidden">When I get shaken up, my mind does too. </p>
        <p id="line5" class="line hidden">Little thoughts suddenly start to bubble to the surface. </p>
        <p id="line6" class="line hidden">⚪</p>
        <p id="line7" class="line hidden">Each and every thing that I worry about is just a mento.</p>
        <p id="line8" class="line hidden">A simple little candy. Nothing all that remarkable on its own.</p>
        <p id="line9" class="line hidden">But when I'm worried about everything all at once...</p>
        <p id="line10" class="line hidden">It feels like I've stuffed as many mentos as I can into my soda bottle brain.</p>
        <p id="line11" class="line hidden">I burst. It's messy. It's gross. I think so, at least.</p>
        <p id="line12" class="line hidden">⚪ </p>
        <p id="line13" class="line hidden">I feel out of control. My thoughts are everywhere.</p>
        <p id="line14" class="line hidden">My worries quickly start to leak out of my rambling lips.</p>
        <p id="line15" class="line hidden">And there's nothing I can do.</p>
        <p id="line16" class="line hidden">There's no stopping an eruption once it starts.</p>
        <p id="line17" class="line hidden">You just have to wait it out and hope it ends soon.</p>
        <p id="line18" class="line hidden">⚪</p>
        <p id="line19" class="line hidden">I still think I'm lucky, all things considered.</p>
        <p id="line20" class="line hidden">I don't explode that often, only on rare occasions.</p>
        <p id="line21" class="line hidden">And I've gotten better at dealing with the aftermath.</p>
        <p id="line22" class="line hidden">I used to resent myself after every little spill.</p>
        <p id="line23" class="line hidden">But not anymore.</p>
        <p id="line24" class="line hidden">⚪</p>
        <p id="line25" class="line hidden">I don't think I'll ever be able to stop the mentos from piling up.</p>
        <p id="line26" class="line hidden">On those unfortunate instances when everything goes wrong at once...</p>
        <p id="line27" class="line hidden">I can't stop myself from bursting.</p>
        <p id="line28" class="line hidden">But that's okay. Because once the eruption is over, I can wash it all away.</p>
        <p id="line29" class="line hidden">In the end, I know I can always screw the cap back on my soda bottle brain.</p>
